This folder contains the location and the locationserver executables for the networking assignment by, Onayo Moro.

The location and locationserver contain the GUI's with the full program. Attachted in their respective folders 
contains their sourcecode in the form of a .cs file.

If Brian Tompsett is reading this text file, I'm not certain if you remember a student asking you about my 
lab 3 test 19 timeout failing on my network drive but passing succefully on the local drive. An error saying 
that the network drive it was running on was not recognised on my account. 

On the Lab1 test 6 I observed my location client openning the GUI after recieving a non-fatal error on test 6
After closing the location client GUI, test 7 proceeds to pass. However this only happend after personally 
clicking the exit button.

I was unaware if this behaviour was normal as the same event was happening for the rest of my class mates.
